        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Emeliy Garcia, I am 19 years old and I go to UCR. I come from Los Angeles and from a very lenient and strict family. I consider myself a very dedicated and motivated individual, not to mention my ability to work well under stressful situations. I have worked in many fast food restaurants and I currently work at Mc Donald's as a cashier. I first started working when I turned 18 to become more independent and to live my life under my own terms, which has been my inspiration for what I do and how I work.<br><br>

        I enjoy what I am studying for and what I do for a living, but I plan to dedicate my life to Education and Public Transport, maybe someday to run for the city council. My experience as a fast food worker has taught me many lessons, some opened my eyes and other helped me be better at what i do. I set a routine to be able to accomplish my daily tasks and to get my work done as best of my ability, as well as efficiently. My experience as an Education Major has taught me the importance of not only going to school but the importance of how school is taught, the improvements that can be made, the importance of the environment that not only children learn in, but also teenagers and even college students. I decided to major in Education because I noticed how many different factors play a significant role in the way students learn. Some of these factor have to do with the teachers themselves and even the classrooms they teach in, and I want to find better ways to bring education to students and their peers.<br><br>

        My goal is to someday be able to look back at all the work I have put into my career and be able to say "I made it". I decided to become independent and live under my own terms, which helps me stay motivated whenever things seem tough. My main values are loyalty, humility, and staying grounded and focused to the bigger picture. My main motivation is myself, how happy I feel and how I will get to a better place in life, by working hard and putting all the hours necessary to get there. One of my biggest strengths is not giving up easily. I have failed many times before but that never stopped me from getting up and keep trying, it only makes me crave a successful life more and helps me think of different ways I can approach a situation and what I need to do in order to accomplish that goal. Another strength I consider very crucial is my ability to learn thing quickly or get the hang of things quick. I consider this important because it helps me adapt to change quickly without falling behind and it gives me an advantage to get my goals done in less amount of time. My inspiration to do what I do is my family and my siblings because they are always there to support me and help me when things don't go as planned.
